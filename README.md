# Snake-Python

A snake game I created using Pthon with the help of youtube tutorial, making use I understood what each line of code was doing and adding my own twist to it,
the game is controlled by the arrow keys on your keyboard (←↑↓→)	 a you have to eat the food without coliding with the egdes of the screen of coming in contact with 
any of the snakes body
